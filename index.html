						<h2>What is TypeScript?</h2>
					</section>

					<section>
						<h3 style="color: burlywood;">JavaScript and More</h3>
						<p>
							<em>TypeScript</em> is an open-source language which builds on JavaScript, one of the world’s most used tools, by adding static type definitions.
							Types provide a way to describe the shape of an object, providing better documentation, and allowing TypeScript to validate that your code is working correctly.
							Writing types can be optional in TypeScript, because type inference allows you to get a lot of power without writing additional code.
						</p>
					</section>

					<section>
						<h3 style="color: burlywood;">A Result You Can Trust</h3>
						<p>
							All valid JavaScript code is also <em>TypeScript</em> code. You might get type-checking errors, but that won't stop you from running the resulting JavaScript. While you can go for stricter behavior, that means you're still in control.
							TypeScript code is transformed into JavaScript code via the TypeScript compiler or Babel. This JavaScript is clean, simple code which runs anywhere JavaScript runs: In a browser, on Node.JS or in your apps.
						</p>
					</section>

					<section>
						<h3 style="color: burlywood;">Gradual Adoption</h3>
						<p>
							Adopting <em>TypeScript</em> is not a binary choice, you can start by annotating existing JavaScript with JSDoc, then switch a few files to be checked by TypeScript and over time prepare your codebase to convert completely.
							TypeScript’s type inference means that you don’t have to annotate your code until you want more safety.
						</p>
					</section>

					<section>
						<h3 style="color: burlywood;">Types On Every Desk</h3>
						<p>
							Most of the world's JavaScript is un-typed, and inference can only go so far. To address this, the TypeScript team helps maintain
							Definitely Typed - a community project to provide types and inline documentation to existing JavaScript.
							This project allows the community to maintain type definitions for JavaScript libraries without putting extra pressure on their maintainers.
						</p>
					</section>

					<section>
						<h3 style="color: burlywood;">Consistently Good Tooling</h3>
						<p>
							By handling a lot of the editor integration inside TypeScript, you can get a consistent experience working in many editors.
							This lets you easily jump between editors like Visual Studio, Visual Studio Code, Nova, Atom, Sublime Text, Emacs, Vim, WebStorm and Eclipse.
							TypeScript's editor integration supports JavaScript, so it's quite likely you're already using TypeScript under the hood.
						</p>
					</section>

					<section>
						<h3 style="color: burlywood;">Evolving with Standards</h3>
						<p>
							The TypeScript team contributes to the TC39 committees which help guide the evolution of the JavaScript language.
							When new features have reached stage 3, then they are ready for inclusion in TypeScript.
							For example the TypeScript team championed proposals like Optional Chaining, Nullish coalescing Operator, Throw Expressions and RegExp Match Indices.

						<h3>What Are the Basic Data Types in TypeScript?</h3>
					</section>

					<section>
						<p>Like JavaScript and any other language, TypeScript also provides basic data types to handle numbers, 
							strings, etc. Some common data types in TypeScript are: number, string, boolean, enum, void, null, undefined, any, never, Array and tuple.
						</p>
					</section>

					<section>
						<h3 style="color: rgb(0, 255, 191);">Number Types</h3>
					</section>

					<section>
						<p>In TypeScript, numbers are floating point values that have a type of number. 
							You can assign any numeric values including decimals, hexadecimals, binary, and octal literals. 
							But to use binary and octal literals, 
							you must use a TypeScript version which follows ECMAScript 2015 or higher.
						</p>

						<pre style="background-color: black; color: burlywood;">let decimalValue: number = 10;</pre>
					</section>

					<section>
						<h3 style="color: rgb(0, 255, 191);">String Types</h3>
					</section>

					<section>
						<p>
							When you want to use textual data, string types are used and get denoted by the keyword string. Like JavaScript, 
							TypeScript also uses double quotes (") and single quotes (') to surround the string value.
						</p>

						<pre style="background-color: black; color: burlywood;">let lastName: string = 'Chowdhury';</pre>
					</section>

					<section>
						<h3 style="color: rgb(0, 255, 191);">Boolean Types</h3>
					</section>

					<section>
						<p>
							To use boolean data types in TypeScript, for declaring variables, use the boolean keyword.
							Here's a simple code to declare a boolean type variable:
						</p>

						<pre style="background-color: black; color: burlywood;">
	let isPrimaryAccount: boolean = true;
	let hasCards: boolean = false;</pre>
					</section>

					<section>
						<h3 style="color: rgb(0, 255, 191);">Enum Types</h3>
					</section>

					<section>
						<p>
							Enumerated data types (enums) are a set of numeric values with more friendly names. 
							It's an addition on top of JavaScript that TypeScript offers. 
							The variables of enumerated data types are declared with the keyword enum. 
							Here's how you can declare an enum variable and use it in TypeScript:
						</p>

						<pre style="background-color: black; color: burlywood;">
	enum CardTypes { Debit, Credit, Virtual }
	let card: CardTypes = CardTypes.Debit;</pre>
					</section>

					<section>
						<h3 style="color: rgb(0, 255, 191);">Void Types</h3>
					</section>

					<section>
						<p>
							In general, this type of data types are used in functions that do not return any value.
								<code style="background-color: black; color: burlywood;">For example,
									function showMessage(): void { ... }
								</code>. In TypeScript, you can also declare a variable of type void,
							but can only assign undefined or null to them. We will discuss undefined and null types in the following sections.
						</p>
					</section>

					<section>
						<h3 style="color: rgb(0, 255, 191);">Null Types</h3>
					</section>

					<section>
						<p>
							You can declare a variable of type null using the null keyword and can assign only null value to it.
							As null is a subtype of all other types, you can assign it to a number or a boolean value.
						</p>

						<pre style="background-color: black; color: burlywood;">
	let nullValue: null = null;
	let numericValue: number = null;</pre>
					</section>

					<section>
						<h3 style="color: rgb(0, 255, 191);">Undefined Types</h3>
					</section>

					<section>
						<p>
							You can use the undefined keyword as a data type to store the value undefined to it.
							As undefined is a subtype of all other types, just like null, you can assign it to a number or a boolean value. 
						</p>

						<pre style="background-color: black; color: burlywood;">
	let undefinedValue: undefined = undefined;
	let numericValue: number = undefined;</pre>
					</section>

					<section>
						<h3 style="color: rgb(0, 255, 191);">Any Types</h3>
					</section>

					<section>
						<p>
							While writing code for which you are unsure of the data type of a value, due to its dynamic content,
							you can use the keyword any to declare said variable. This is often useful when you are seeking input from users or at third-party library/service.
							This is also useful when you are declaring an array which has a mixed data type.
							It's just like the dynamic keyword available in C#. For example:
						</p>

						<pre style="background-color: black; color: burlywood;">
	let dynamicValue: any = "Kunal Chowdhury";
	dynamicValue = 100;
	dynamicValue = 0b1100101;
	dynamicValue = true;</pre>
					</section>

					<section>
						<h3 style="color: rgb(0, 255, 191);">Never Types</h3>
					</section>

					<section>
						<p>
							The never type represents the data type of values that never occur.
							For example, the following function that always throws an exception can never return a value.
							Thus, the return type of the function can be set as never. Here's the function declaration:
						</p>

						<pre style="background-color: black; color: burlywood;">
	function throwError(message: string): never {
		throw new Error(message);
	}</pre>
					</section>

					<section>
						<h3 style="color: rgb(0, 255, 191);">Array Types</h3>
					</section>

					<section>
						<p>
							Just like JavaScript, you can work with arrays in TypeScript and can define them in either of the following two ways;
							the second approach, however, is the more generic way to declare arrays:
						</p>

						<pre style="background-color: black; color: burlywood;">
	let marks: number[] = [80, 85, 75];</pre>
					</section>

					<section>
						<h3 style="color: rgb(0, 255, 191);">Tuple Types</h3>
					</section>

					<section>
						<p>
							A tuple is a data type that allows you to create an array where the type of a fixed number of elements are 
							known but need not be same. While accessing an element of a Tuple with a valid known index, the data of 
							correct type will be returned. In case you access an element outside the set of known indices, a union type 
							will be used. Consider the following code snippet as an example:
						</p>

						<pre style="background-color: black; color: burlywood;">
	let person: [string, number] = ["Hello world", 2021];</pre>
